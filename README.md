# codeforces-problems

## Introduction
Author: Josh Hayden

This is a public repository of my Codeforces workflow. All of these solutions are my complete original work. 

## Layout
/src --- All source files, organized by language. The solutions are divided into directories by language. In each language directory, there is a template file named TEMPLATE.extention (.py, .c, .cpp). This is the template layout for each language's solution file. They may differ slightly.

/util --- Scripts and utilities (Checking language solutions for a given problem, etc). Includes verification scripts for format checking.
