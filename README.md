# Codeforces Problems

A public collection of all my solutions for the Codeforces problemset, organized by language.

All of these solutions are my own original work.




## Contributing

This is my personal workflow for working on Codeforces, and as such, it doesn't make much sense to accept contributions in any typical way. 

I do however, welcome guidance and insight regarding how I solved different problems. If you see a solution of mine that you believe is done in a counterintuitive way (or simply could be improved), reach out to me via email at blindcollective@protonmail.com. I always welcome new opportunities for me to learn. What may seem obvious to you could be a subject that I have no knowlege of. 




## Usage/Examples

Though my problems are strictly my own work, if you decided to use my workflow as a template for your own Codeforces work, the /util/ directory could be of use to you. Run util.py to use my simple analysis script of the problemset in /src/.

Use the --help flag for more information about the various usable commands.
```python
python3 util.py --help
```
